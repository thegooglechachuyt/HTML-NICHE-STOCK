<h1><font color="FF0000">WHAT IS A NICHE MARKET?</font></h1>
<p><font size="5.4"><b><u>A niche market is the subset of the market on which a specific product is focused.</b></u> The market niche defines the product features aimed at satisfying specific market needs, as well as the price range, production quality and the demographics that it is intended to target. It is also a small market segment. Sometimes, a product or service can be entirely designed to satisfy a niche market. Not every product can be defined by its market niche. The niche market is highly specialized, and aiming to survive among the competition from numerous super companies.</p>

<img src="nichemarket2.jpeg" width="700" >

<p> Even established companies create products for different niches; <b>Hewlett-Packard, for example</b> has all-in-one machines for printing, scanning and faxing targeted for the home office niche, while at the same time having separate machines with one of these functions for big businesses. While you may have explicit moving items effectively at the top of the priority list. Although you can build your chances of achievement by beginning with a niche market. In practice, product vendors and trade businesses are commonly referred to as mainstream providers or narrow demographics niche market providers <b>(colloquially shortened to just niche market providers)</b>. Small capital providers usually opt for a niche market with narrow demographics as a measure of increasing their financial gain margins. The final product quality (low or high) is not dependent on the price elasticity of demand, but the specific needs that the product is aimed to satisfy and, in some cases, aspects of brand recognition <b>(e.g. prestige, practicability, money saving, expensiveness, environmental conscience, or social status)</b>. When there are needs or desires with specific and even complex characteristics, the market niche requires specialized suppliers which are capable of meeting such expectations.</p>

<h1><font color="FF0000">NICHE AUDIENCE</font></h1>

<p><font size="5.4">If we talk about Niche audience, then it is influentially smaller audience. Niche audiences are now in much greater control of what they watch. This happens because in T.V., <b>technology and many industrial practices changed with the post network era.</b>T.V. networks and production companies are trying to find new ways to discover through new scheduling, new television shows and relying on syndication. This is called a practice of <b><i><u>narrowcasting.</u></i></b> This narrowcasting allows advertisetrs to have a more direct audience for their messages. <u><b>e.g. Sports channel, like STARPLUS, ESPN, etc. target the niche market of sport enthusiasts.</b></u></font></p>

<h1><font color="FF0000">SUB-NICHE MARKET</font></h1>
<p>A Sub-Niche market is  even a smaller unit of Niche. You might wonder how smaller it will be. <b>A Sub-Niche market is a very small market niche having a specific appeal.</b> It is a small group of individuals who are removed from mainstream marketplace. A niche market may become so large that it may seem that it is part of a mainstream group when actuality it is still a niche. It can then be divided into a smaller group of individuals within the niche itself.</p>

<h1><font color="green">Etymology</font></h1>
<p>The term <b>sub-niche was first used by internet marketers to describe people or products in the market who are in very small niches.</b> When used in business a sub-niche is targeted for selling products or services that are more suited for these individuals than the larger niche.</p>

<h1><font color="green">Marketing for and in sub-niche markets</font></h1>
<p>Sub-Niche Marketing is the process of finding niche markets where the individuals can be broken down into smaller subsets of the niche itself. Usually <b>this occurs in larger niche markets </b>where the niche may no longer be targeted enough to satisfy the entire population of that niche. While the product and/or services provided by that particular niche serve to fulfill a need it may not to so to the highest degree. In this case <b>a sub-niche would serve this purpose.</b></p>
<br>

<h1><font color="green">Online sub-niche marketing</font></h1>
<p>This technique is often used by affiliate marketers. The sub-niche is a more profitable group based in the internet market as opposed to a tangible marketplace because of the specificity required in targeting such a market. Online business has little start up cost and can afford and even target multiple sub-niche markets to create a steady form of revenue. The technique of sub-niche marketing is duplicated in multiple markets to achieve the desired amount of income.</p>
